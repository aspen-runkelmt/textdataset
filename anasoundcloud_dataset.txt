Mired in semi-retirement from professional racing and late career stagnation, he set his sights on the Appalachian Trail speed record in 2015. Scott and his wife Jenny approached this project as relative novices and their collaborative narrative account, North, tells the amazing story of their 46-day, 2,189-mile AT adventure. The book is about so much more than running, and in this conversation we interrogate some of those larger topics â\x80\x93 relationships, communication, loss, triumph and community.
